# Computer Vision

During this pandemic I proposed myself to polish my Computer Vision and Deep Learning skills by doing from basic to advanced lectures found online.

All my projects that served its purposed of teaching me something about CV and DL will be pushed to this repository in its own folder.

I am excited to see what I will create sooooo let's see where I get!
